## Connecting Communities, Empowering Ownership.

Coop wants to provide a platform for people to meet specifically with the idea in mind to
co-own a property together. Targeted specifically towards young people
who have never owned a property before, we the founders also understand what it's like to
look at the current housing market in the USA and feel the dread of trying to buy your own home.
Many things in life are hard and have to be done alone. Buying a home doesn't have to be one of them.

There are many reasons to consider co-ownership of properties. As part of our vision, we want
to emphasize the community aspect. In the wake of a current loneliness epidemic, we think
that trying to put efforts into fostering more communities that people actually want to be apart of
will ease the collective pain and suffering. Lots of people tackle this problem from different angles, and
we will come from the angle of trying to get people to commit to living together. Reducing physical distance
between old friends or new friends reduces the friction of trying to hang out and do things together or
even something as necessary and difficult like planning group trips.

Let's make great communities and learn, love, and laugh together.
