# SQL
This directory contains all the SQL schema and queries written for the backend of the Coop app.
PostgreSQL specific SQL keywords are used. The schema is written to be used by the [Goose](https://pressly.github.io/goose/) tool (database migration)
and the queries are written to be used by the [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/) tool (idiomatic code generation from SQL).
